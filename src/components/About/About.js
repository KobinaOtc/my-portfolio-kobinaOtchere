          Hello, My name is Kobina Adjoku Otchere and I’m a Fullstack Developer. I have a big passion for programing and I believe that it is an avenue for solving most of the issues around us. Linux is my preferred operating system when it comes to programing but I am also quite familiar with Windows. I love the concept of open source programing and all its benefits. When I’m not doing main stream work, I find myself working on personal programs, graphic designs and cooking. I also love to engage in deep meaningful conversations. Here is my email if you wish to get in contact with me, kobinaotchereadjoku@gamil.com.
